  <h2>Lab Note #002 — Is USB 5V Good Enough?</h2>
  <p><em>Published: February 2026</em></p>

  <p>
  I’m working on something that started as a small circuit and is slowly turning into something more serious.
  </p>

  <p>
  It runs from USB.
  </p>

  <p>
  At first, I did what I always do — route VBUS to the 5V rail and move on.
  </p>

  <p>
  That’s how most dev boards work.<br>
  It’s simple.<br>
  It usually behaves.
  </p>

  <p>
  But this build isn’t meant to be “usually fine.”
  </p>

  <p>
  The more I looked at it, the more I realized USB 5V is really just “close enough.”
  </p>

  <p>
  Different ports sit at slightly different voltages.<br>
  Cables drop a little under load.<br>
  Switching relays or driving outputs can nudge the rail just enough to matter.
  </p>

  <p>
  For quick prototypes, that’s acceptable.
  </p>

  <p>
  For something that’s supposed to behave like a bench tool — predictable, repeatable — it feels like cutting a corner.
  </p>

  <p>
  So instead of trusting VBUS directly, I added a current-limited input stage and a buck-boost converter to generate a steady internal rail just under 5V.
  </p>

  <p>
  It might be overkill.
  </p>

  <p>
  But I’d rather eliminate variables now than debug strange behavior later and wonder if it was the cable.
  </p>

  <p>
  Small decisions like this are starting to define whether this stays a prototype — or becomes something more refined.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you’ve built something similar and have strong opinions about USB power architecture, I’d genuinely like to hear them.

    <h2>Lab Note #001 — The Board I Built After Frying Too Many Dev Kits</h2>
    <p><em>Published: February 2026</em></p>

    <p>If you prototype long enough, you’ll eventually do it.</p>

    <p>
    Reverse polarity.<br>
    Hot-plug a supply.<br>
    Grab the wrong wall adapter.<br>
    Move a jumper one pin over.
    </p>

    <p>And something quietly dies.</p>

    <p>I’ve done it enough times to stop pretending it wouldn’t happen again.</p>

    <p>
    So I built a small inline protection board that lives between my power source and whatever I’m testing.
    </p>

    <p>Nothing fancy. Just:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>MOSFET-based reverse polarity protection</li>
      <li>A TVS diode for transient suppression</li>
      <li>A resettable polyfuse (500mA or ~1.1A versions)</li>
      <li>3V–24V DC pass-through</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    It does <strong>not</strong> regulate voltage.<br>
    It won’t save you from intentionally feeding 24V into a 5V board.
    </p>

    <p>
    But it will absorb the kinds of mistakes that tend to happen when you're moving fast, tired, or swapping supplies mid-debug.
    </p>

    <p>
    It’s basically a small layer of insurance between you and an avoidable failure.
    </p>

    <p>
    No firmware.<br>
    No measurements.<br>
    No blinking LEDs.
    </p>

    <p>
    Just something that sits there quietly and takes the hit instead of your board.
    </p>

    <p>
    If that sounds useful, you can find it on our <a href="products.html">Products page</a>.

    <p>More small lab tools coming soon.</p>
